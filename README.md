# Ranescript
A scripting language experiment

## Key Ideas:

**RSG** -- Reduced Syntax Grammar. To increase power, reduce syntax. Too much time, energy, money, neurons, etc is spent on syntactic variation. Great IDE's, Debuggers, etc are much easier to create without the overhead of TIMTOWDI, without excessive energies dumped into supporting 10 different indentation styles, multiple optional syntaxes, etc.

**IDE Co-development** -- The IDE developed while the language is developing. The IDE a user needs should be with the inital release.
